# An analysis of Department of Health and Human Services Funding in California

## Rodrigo Gonz√°lez Laiz & Katie Truong

### Introduction and Motivation:


### Explotary Analysis:

- What's the amount of award funded across over the years (adjusted for inflation)? How is it spent across different counties? What are the counties that spend the most money? Can we explain why?

- What's the correlation between the counties' demographics, and how they spend money?
  Population, Age, Gender, Marriage, Race, Education, Median Income (in categories such as Administration for Children and Families, Administration on Aging, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Health Resources and Services Administration)

**B. What's the correlation between the counties' population and demographics, and how they spend money?**

To answer this question, we can look at [Census data in 2017](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/ca) and compare it with how money was spent across county in 2017.

- **Population and obligation:**

There is a positive, but weak correlation (0.24) between the population of a county, and the amount of money it's funded/awarded.
